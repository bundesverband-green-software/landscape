              While particularly valuable for compute-intensive workloads like machine learning, it's designed for broad applicability across various use cases.
              The tool supports two usage modes. The Python Context Manager is ideal for instrumenting Python code directly. This mode allows developers to wrap specific code blocks to measure energy consumption with precision. 
              The Command-Line Interface is designed to tag and monitor running application without modifying the code. This mode is currently under active development and not yet available.

Software-defined power meters are configurable software libraries that can estimate the power consumption of software in real-time. PowerAPI supports the acquisition of raw metrics from a wide diversity of sensors (eg., physical meters, processor interfaces, hardware counters, OS counters) and the delivery of power consumptions via different channels (including file system, network, web, graphical). As a middleware toolkit, PowerAPI offers the capability of assembling power meters «à la carte» to accommodate user requirements.
